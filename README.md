# Real Estate API 

A rails API application that is consumed by [Real-Estate-Client](https://github.com/wathigo/Real-Estate-Client/blob/property/README.md). The application handled user authentication using [JWT](https://jwt.io/). There are endpoints that require authentication/protected endpoints and those that don't.

Let's start by listing the list of unprotected endpoints:
* POST /authenticate. The endpoint used to authenticate/log in a user.
* POST /auth/signup. The endpoint that is used when creating a new user.
* GET /categories. Endpoint used for getting all the categories.
* GET /properties. The endpoint used to fetch all the properties.
* GET /properties/:id. Used to get a specific property record.

All the other endpoint requires the user to be authenticated. They include:
* GET /user. Endpoint used to retrieve the current user.
* PATCH /categories/:id. Used to update specific fields of an already existing category record.
* PUT /categories/:id. Used to update all the fields of an existing category record.
* DELETE /categories/:id. Used to delete an existing category record.
* POST /properties. Used to create a new property record.
* PATCH /properties/:id. Used to update specific fields of an existing property record.
* PUT /properties/:id. Used to update all the fields of an existing property record.
* DELETE /properties/:id. Used to delete an existing property record.
* PUT /add_geo_location. Creates a geo_location record for an existing propery record.
* GET /geo_location. Fetches the geo_location record for an existing property record.
* PUT /add_favourites. Creates a favourite record for the current user.
* GET /my_favourites. Gets all the favourite properties of the current user.

All of the above endpoints have been tested for the negative and positive scenarios.
